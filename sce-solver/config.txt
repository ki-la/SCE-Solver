# EXPLANATION OF SOLVER OPTIONS:
# solver: 0 -> search-tree solver, 1 -> ilp solver, 2 -> heuristic solver
# graph_data_structure: 0 -> graph, 1 -> pgraph, 2 -> pgraph_map
# branching: 0 -> branch until UB reached, 1 -> k-loop
# apply_packing_lb: apply Packing Lower Bound in every x'th recursive step (0: never apply it)
# apply_mincut_lb: how often to apply MinCut Lower Bound during the branching
# apply_data_reduction: how often to apply more expensive Data Reduction during the branching
